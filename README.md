# TavernLightGamesTechnicalTests
2024's TavernLightGames software developer technical test attempt


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When it came to server question I was un able to get the server to even run on 
my end. I was unsure what was the issue since I went from using v1.4.0 of 
forgotten server before deleting everything and switching to lates version being 1.4.2.
during that time when I switched I relised that is said in the compiling section that
the only working compiling method was using vcpkg if I was going to use 1.4.2 as
well as possibily also being the issue for 1.4.0. The other issue came when following
the instructions in the compiling sections and trying to build the server it would do varyious 
boost files not running. Tryed various methods at this point from downloading the 
old c++ library to eventually deleting everything and starting over again multiple times
with the final attempt installing the librarys differently based on the recommendation that boost-filesystem 
wasn't nessary. None of these attemps worked so I was stumped and no real way of even tackling
questions 5-7. So it really came down to my stuburn nature if I haven't menationed
it already that I tend to attempt everything on my own and have a hard time gaging when to 
reach out for help. Mostly wanted to write this down as a reminder of what happend and to stort of go 
through the motions of showing what was going on so that I can understand where I can improve for the future.
If you are the recruter reading this I want to take the time to thank you again if I haven't thanked you already in the email
for taking the time to read this and give me a chance. Hope the recruiting process goes smoothly for you can the team. 
Hope you have a good rest of your day or night.
